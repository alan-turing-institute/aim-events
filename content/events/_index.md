# September Event Series

Throughout September, the AIM Research Support Facility is hosting a series of events open to
the AIM Consortia and Research Partners centred around Patient and
Public Involvement and Engagement (PPIE). In these sessions, attendees
will learn from a range of projects, methods, and approaches and
ultimately get insight into how PPIE can be implemented successfully.
