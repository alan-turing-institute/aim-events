Meag Doherty of National Institute of Health's All of Us research program presents "Everyone has a Say: Embedding human-centred design (HCD) in the research setting" and discusses how elements of Human-Centred Design and its frameworks have been used by the National Institute of Health's All of Us research program to â€œbuild one of the most diverse health databases in history".

**Tuesday 13th September, 13:30 - 14:30**

## Introduction

The AIM RSF Seminars are a regular series of open invitation talks from leading voices in data
 science, AI, healthcare and those with lived experience dealing with
multiple long-term conditions (MLTC).

This talk is part of a series of events that the RSF is hosting in
September, all centred around Patient and Public Involvement and
Engagement (PPIE). In this seminar session, we hope that attendees will
learn about human-centred design and how this learning can be applied to
 their respective areas of research.

## About the event

Human-Centred Design is the intentional process of building products and experiences
in direct collaboration with the intended audience and can be a useful
approach when designing research that focuses on public and patient
experience.

In this talk, Meag Doherty will first explain the key elements of
Human-Centred Design and how its frameworks are useful for Patient and
Public Involvement and Engagement research projects. She will then
describe how to get started with applying these frameworks at a
programme level, and how to advocate for the inclusion of patients
throughout a project. Finally, she will provide an example of applying
Human-Centred Design specifically in a health programme, by discussing
All of Us, a Research Programme of the National Institutes for Health
aiming to recruit one million people across the US "to build one of the
most diverse health databases in history".

## Register now

Everyone is welcome at this session, however, the target audience is clinicians,
policymakers and health data science researchers. We hope that
attendees will learn more about this HCD method and how this learning
can be applied to multiple long-term conditions research.
