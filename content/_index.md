# AIM Research Support Facility

The AIM Research Support Facility (RSF), based at The Alan Turing Institute with collaborators from Swansea University and the University of Edinburgh, offers AI and advanced data science support to the research teams part of the [NIHR&#39;s Artificial Intelligence for Multiple Long-Term Conditions (AIM)](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/blog/artificial-intelligence-to-understand-clusters-of-multiple-long-term-conditions-an-nihr-priority/25171) project.

During the month of September, the AIM RSF is hosting a series of events open to the AIM Consortia and Research Partners centred around Patient and Public Involvement and Engagement (PPIE). In these sessions, attendees will learn from a range of projects, methods, and approaches and ultimately get insight into how PPIE can be implemented successfully.
